- Explore the [Interactive Database](https://gaza-reporters.github.io/database/)

## Goal
Our goal is to build up a News App that tracks all the journalists who have been killed in Gaza during the war. We built up two main pages: 
1) **Story Page** - We created a narrative featuring journalists who were killed in 2024, along with an interactive map. Each dot on the map represents a killed journalist. We focused on several of these killings, using video news or social media images to illustrate the impact of the attacks that claimed their lives.
2) **Database Page** -  we created a database that contains detailed information about all the journalists who were killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 2000. By searching through the timeline, readers can also find the latest personal information about journalists who have died since last October in the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.

## Targeted Readers and Users
- A Journalist seeking to understand where, when and how journalists have been killed during the conflict
- A researcher or NGO worker, seeking detailed and navigable information on the topic
- A member of a news organization who has lost a colleague to the conflict 
- An advocate for press safety looking to access data and understand it over time and space
- A highly engaged news reader, seeking more in depth analysis

## Data Source
The data on killed journalists were extracted from the [Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)](https://cpj.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to defending the rights of journalists worldwide. They provide invaluable data and advocacy for press freedom and journalist safety.
