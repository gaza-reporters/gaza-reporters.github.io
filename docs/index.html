                    The war in Gaza has been the single most deadly conflict for journalists since records began in 1981. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More than five times as many journalists have been killed in Gaza than in Ukraine, and over 75% of all journalists killed in 2023 were killed in Gaza. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The vast majority of those killed are Palestinian and archives of their work can be found across their social media and publishing history. 17 journalists have been killed in Gaza in 2024. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is the story of the reporters who gave their lives in 2024, to document the war and report from Gaza.

    <p>His editor shared these reflections on Atallah’s career: “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was that he thought he would survive.”</p>
